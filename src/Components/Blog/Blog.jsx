                                                Context API is a fairly new concept in the world of React. It is designed to share data that can be considered global for a tree of React components. Context API is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. So, When we want to share data between components without using props or actions, we use context API. Because Context API can significantly reduce the complexity of state management in application.

                                                useRef hook is part of the React Hooks API. It is a function which takes a maximum of one argument and returns an Object. The returned object has a property called current whose value is the argument passed to useRef. If you invoke it without an argument, the returned object's current property is set to undefined. <br /> <code>useRef</code> hook syntax is: <br /> <code>const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);</code>

                                                The useMemo is a hook used in the functional component of react that returns a memoized value. In Computer Science, memoization is a concept used in general when we donâ€™t need to recompute the function with a given argument for the next time as it returns the cached result. A memoized function remembers the results of output for a given set of inputs.
